# This generates a few datasets for our tests to run on.  (It is not efficient
# to just store them in GitHub.)  It is assumed that the PLINK 1.9 build to be
# tested is named/symlinked as "plink2", and a PLINK 1.07 build is
# named/symlinked as "plink1".

# When the number of samples isn't divisible by 4, special-case logic is
# sometimes needed to handle the last data byte for each variant.  This has
# been a source of bugs, so it's important to have a test case for each sample
# count remainder mod 4.

# 385 samples x 1089 markers should be a large enough dataset to test generic
# advancement loops, and the lower the runtime of the test suite, the more
# frequently it can be run.
